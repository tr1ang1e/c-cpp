 * Type description:
 *   - VLA size is known only in run time (declarator is not an integer_constant_expression (see docs))
 *   - memory for VLA is allocated on stack and doesn't require free() call
 *   - exists only in the scope of the declaration
 *   - cannot be a part of structure or union
 *   - have hidden variable to store the size value wich might be associated with several VLA
 *   - { } initializers are forbidden for VLA 
 *
