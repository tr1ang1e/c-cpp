/* Both binary and text files might be considered as bytes sequenc—É
 *
 * The differences are:
 *   1) text files have escape sequnces (e.g. '\n') which might be interpreted by reader
 *   2) working with binary file means interpretation data as unsigned char sequence
 * So the binary file consumer must know how to decode data which where packed to it
 * The possible way to think of it:
 *   - text operations like a strcpy() function = always strings
 *   - binary operationc like a memcpy() function = any data types, programmer must control compatibility
 * 
 * Binary file interaction operations = 
 *   the same as text files  ::  fopen(), fclose()
 *   special read-write ops  ::  fread(), fwrite()
 *   
 * Binary file opening modes = the same as for text file + 'b'
 *   rb  ,  r+b   ::  read   , read-write
 *   wb  ,  w+b   ::  write  , read-write 
 *   ab  ,  a+b   ::  append , read-write
 *   wbx ,  w+bx  ::  create file if doesn't exist and don't share access to it while it is opened
 *
