/* According to Eric S. Raymond: "The lost art of structure packing"
 * 
 * Alignment is used for simplify process of CPU gets data and make it faster
 * There are two ways to achieve alignment:
 *		- stack = var 1: padding (non-optimize compilation), var 2: change variables with their places (optimization)
 *      - structures = only padding is applied
 *
 * Alignment requirements								
 *		1-byte types  >>  have not requirements (and their arrays as well >> 'char' and 'char[]')	
 *      2-byte types  >>  must start on even address				
 *      4-byte types  >>  must start on address divisible by 4		
 *      8-byte types  >>  must start on address divisible by 8
 * Sign'ess doesn't affect alignment
 * 
 * [!] terms
 * Padding = process of adding empty bytes to meet alignment requirements 
 * Packing = process of keeping structure with 'as is' size
 * 
 * [!]
 * Padding bytes are not guaranteed to be zeroes!
 * 
 * [!]
 * the presented requirements are commonly used and almost the standard >> the jargon for them is "self-alignment"
 * but be aware of possibility if different approach to the data alignment (especially in embedded systems)
